# Scope: LLM Arena

Send one prompt, watch up to three AI models answer it at the same time, and vote for the best one. Over time those votes and the real per-call numbers, speed, tokens, cost, build an honest leaderboard of which model is actually worth using.

Build it in a thin, working slice first, one prompt actually reaching a model and coming back, before making any single part of it fuller. Then thicken it piece by piece. Before building anything, decide what you're doing and why in a few plain sentences, then build it, and if the plan turns out wrong once it's actually built, say so and fix the plan too, not just the code.

Whenever a "build it" style step actually gets underway, break it into its own short list of what's genuinely being done, and check each part off as it's finished, right in this file. That way this file can be opened fresh, in a brand new conversation, and it's obvious what's already done and what's still left, without anyone re-explaining the feature from scratch.

## Stack

Already decided, nothing open here: Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn for components (card, button, popover, loading skeleton, and whatever else the UI actually needs as it gets built), Prisma with Postgres, Clerk for auth, Arcjet in front of the endpoint, PostHog for analytics and observability.

## Sketches

There are rough hand-drawn sketches for the arena screen, the leaderboard, and the models page. Treat them as structure only, where things sit, what exists on the page, not as the final design or the actual colors, all of that is already decided elsewhere in this file. If something in a sketch genuinely contradicts what's written here, stop and ask which one actually wins rather than guessing.

## Foundation

### 1. How the app actually connects to a model

The Next.js project itself gets created manually first, `create-next-app`, fast and simple, no reason to spend agent time or tokens on something that easy.

Two real decisions still open once that exists: how the app calls OpenRouter to get a model's answer, and how streaming three models back to the browser at once should actually work. This one's worth real thought: routing all three through one shared connection looks simpler, but if that one connection drops, all three answers die together, which breaks the whole point of one model failing never affecting the others. Decide both properly, then wire them, along with Prisma, Clerk, and Arcjet, into the project that already exists.

PostHog should be wired in from the start too, session replay and heatmaps turned on, and tied to the signed-in user once Clerk resolves, so events are attached to a real person, not left anonymous.

Decided: the app calls OpenRouter through the Vercel AI SDK (`ai` + `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider`), streaming on the plain Node runtime, no edge. Three models never share one connection, since that would make one dropping take the other two down with it, defeating the whole point of independent failure. `POST /api/chat` streams one model's answer at a time; the browser calls it three times in parallel, once per selected model, each with its own connection and its own reader. A follow-up just calls it again with that model's own growing message history. Enough Clerk to know who's asking is wired in now (`clerkMiddleware`, `ClerkProvider`, `auth()` gating the route); Prisma, Arcjet, and the rest of PostHog stay with their own features so this doesn't balloon into one untracked step.

- [x] Decide the approach
- [x] Build it: `lib/env.ts` (fail fast on missing vars), `lib/openrouter.ts`, `lib/model-stream.ts` (SSE framing: `chunk` / `error` / `done`, errors never leak the raw exception), `app/api/chat/route.ts`, `middleware.ts` + `ClerkProvider` in `app/layout.tsx`
- [ ] Verify by hand: confirmed live under a real signed-in session — Clerk auth resolved, Arcjet passed, `streamText` was called, and a genuine provider error (bad model id) was caught and masked into the plain human message correctly. A successful model response hasn't been seen yet; not worth a dedicated round to force one, will happen naturally once feature #5 (model picker) gives a real model id to send.

### 2. Coding standards & tooling

Write down the real conventions for this project once it actually exists, then install linting, formatting, and a pre-commit hook that actually enforces them.

- [ ] Decide the approach
- [ ] Install lint, format, and whatever else is needed, and write it up in a coding-standards doc

### 3. Data model

The core things every feature depends on: users tied to Clerk, threads, each model's own messages inside a thread, and votes. A vote should only ever be possible on a turn where two or more models actually answered.

- [ ] Decide the approach
- [ ] Build it

### 4. Design & look

A coffee or dark brown background, warm, not neutral gray or true black. One accent color, rust, used only for things you interact with, buttons, links, focus states, the win-rate bar, never as decoration. Because the background and the accent are both warm tones from the same family, the accent has to stay clearly brighter and more saturated than the background, enough that a button never blends into the page behind it, that's a real risk with two warm colors this close and worth checking by eye, not just by the numbers. Blue, indigo, and purple are never the accent, under any circumstance. Green is reserved only for marking a winner, red only for errors, never reused for anything else. Contrast should genuinely hold up in both light and dark mode, not just look fine at a glance.

## Slice 1: Core arena loop

### 5. Model picker

An "Add model" popover pulling OpenRouter's live free-tier list, sorted by context window, capped at three models, defaulting to all three selected, with removable chips next to the prompt box. Also render that same catalog as a simple `/models` page, name, context window, and pricing for each one, so anyone can browse the full list without opening the picker.

- [ ] Build it

### 6. Send a prompt, parallel streams, and voting

The heart of the product. One prompt goes to every selected model at once, each streaming and failing independently, so one being slow or down never blocks the others. Each answer shows its own real time-to-first-token, tokens per second, and total tokens. No cost shown, every model here is free tier, so it would always read zero. A vote only exists once two or more models have answered, and picking one writes exactly one vote and marks that answer as the winner, while every answer stays visible the whole time. A follow-up continues each model's own separate conversation.

Arcjet sits in front of this endpoint before any model is ever called: rate limiting, bot protection, and a shield against prompt injection, plus a real limit on how much one person can use across all three models at once, not just a limit on the endpoint overall.

Decided (Arcjet, ahead of the full feature): `lib/arcjet.ts` wires `shield`, `detectBot`, `detectPromptInjection`, and a `tokenBucket` (capacity 20, refill 5/10s) keyed on `userId` rather than IP, so the limit is shared across the three parallel per-model calls one prompt will eventually make, not per-connection. Wired into `app/api/chat/route.ts` after auth, before the model is called. Passes build/lint; the live 429 and prompt-injection denials have **not** been triggered by hand yet, needs a signed-in browser session sending rapid/adversarial prompts.

Decided (per-call metrics, ahead of the full feature): `lib/model-stream.ts` now computes `ttft`, `outputTokens`, and `tokensPerSecond` and sends them on the `done` SSE event (`app/api/chat/route.ts` captures `requestStart` right before `streamText()`, after auth/Arcjet, so the number times the model only). `tokensPerSecond` is wall-clock throughput, `outputTokens / (finish − requestStart)`, not per-delta timing, since some OpenRouter providers stream token-by-token and others buffer-and-flush, and a delta-timing-based number would measure that difference instead of real model speed. Confirmed the fields exist and typecheck against `ai@7.0.62`; not yet verified by hand that the numbers look sane on a real streamed answer. No UI reads these yet.

Prisma (data model) is separate and still fully open, see feature #3.

## Slice 2: App shell & thread history

### 7. App shell & thread history

The frame everything else sits inside: a top bar and sidebar that stay in place while the page scrolls, the thread's name, and each model's win record shown right there (shrinking down to a small dot and number if it gets crowded). The sidebar lists a signed-in user's own past threads so the tool actually feels usable across visits, not just in one sitting.

- [ ] Build it

## Slice 3: Public visibility & sharing

### 8. Public thread visibility & sharing

Anyone should be able to open a thread's link and see it, without an account, that's what actually makes it shareable. Only sending a prompt and voting need sign-in. A made-up or deleted thread just shows a plain not-found page either way. The thread's real owner sees everything everyone else sees, plus the ability to actually use it.

- [ ] Build it

## Slice 4: Leaderboard

### 9. Leaderboard: global & personal

Two leaderboards from the same votes, one for everyone, one just for the signed-in user. Each row's win rate is the big, bold number, in the accent color, with a small bar next to it, always written as "won 4 of 5," never a bare percentage or a made-up score. Smaller, quieter numbers underneath for average speed and time-to-first-token, each clearly labeled. No cost or "cheapest" stat, every model is free, so that number never means anything here. First place gets a subtle highlight, nobody else does.

- [ ] Build it

## Not doing right now

Kept here so the plan stays honest about what's deliberately left out.

- A "fastest" label on the leaderboard, tagging whichever model already has the best average speed, only for models with enough votes to mean anything. Nice to have, not required.
- Giving each model's own little icon a distinct look instead of plain gray. Nice to have, not required.
- Privacy policy and terms pages.
- Rich link previews when a thread gets shared somewhere.
- Any kind of admin or moderation page.
- A public API for the leaderboard data. Nobody's asked for this.
